				<h3>Our People</h3>
				
				<p align="justify"><b>Meet Our People</b><br><br>
We are a missions focused, like-minded group of volunteers who have been working together since 2003 in leading Refuge Christian Ministries International forward in the vision God has laid on the founders hearts.<br><br>

Our leadership team provides Refuge CMI with the inspiration and direction to keep it going and growing.</p><br>

<center><img src="images/o1.png"width="100%"></center>
<p align="justify">Dr. Paul & Marcy Olson were born and raised in Minnesota. Paul attended Trinity Bible College, International Seminary, Cochise College, Arizona State University, and earned his Doctor of Divinity from Master’s International School of Divinity. They have served as pastors, children’s evangelists, chaplain, trainers, and missionaries. <br><br>
On January 14, 2000, their 22 year old daughter, Daralee, passed away from diabetes complications leaving three beautiful children who have been raised by the Olsons.  God has used these experiences to more effectively minister to others in similar situations.  They have dealt with the stress and heartache of prodigal children, and they have dealt with cancer in several situations.  They can truly attest that God is faithful and will see you through the most difficult valleys in life.  As the gospel song says, “The God of the mountain, is still God in the valley.”  Many times, when ministering in churches, they have opportunity to minister to others going through these kinds of trials.<br><br>
In July 2003, they traveled to Kenya and Uganda East Africa on a mission trip that had a major impact on their lives and ministry. They returned to Kenya in 2004 with a team.  Their team ministered to and fed orphans and street children, conducted workshops for pastors and teachers, and purchased materials for a water project.  In 2005 and 2007 they went to King’s Kids Orphanage in Guaymas, Sonora, Mexico.  In 2006 they traveled to Belize.  In 2008 their travels included Mexico and Haiti where they participated in preaching, teaching, medical, and construction.  In 2009 they returned to Haiti and Mexico.  In 2010 their time was focused on getting their grandchildren settled in their home.  They have returned to Haiti in 2011, 2012 and 2013.  Haiti is an annual missions event.<br><br>
They have a burden to see the American church catch the vision of the harvest, and find their places in the harvest field in these last days.  That is why they have invested time, money, and energy to train American Christians in the essence of the call of God on their lives, and also focus on training national pastors and workers to build up a national church that will be able to spiritually stand against the false doctrines, cults, religions and other tricks of Satan in these last of the last days.</p><br>

The Olson’s and the Taylor’s shared holidays together and their children grew up together. <br><br>

In 2008 Fred joined the Olsons during the ministry’s trip to Haiti.  Fred and his wife Linda have been a real blessing to the ministry through their service and support over the years.<br><br>
